### - **This app won't be given up on!!**:
Using google's API's we collect user demographic to see where our targetted audience resides in, for areas where there's a majority of the audience more research might be done to better tailor the algorithm to that area. Rigth now its optimized for areas residing in the states/provinces Ontario and Quebec in Canada. The algorithm is robust enough that it will still be 90% accurate for all other areas!
